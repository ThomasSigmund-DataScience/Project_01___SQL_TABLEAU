# Case Study - Expansion to the Brazilian market via Magist
## Summary
This analysis discusses whether our company - Eniac - should start a partnership with a Brazilian Software as a Service company - Magist - to sell its products.

## Tools, Languages and Libraries Used
- Tableau - to generate the plots to get more insights concerning Magist´s data
- SQL - to investigate the data in a detailed manner

## Key Learnings
- In the course of this case study we analyzed Magist´s product categories, average sales, growth rate, delivery times and even customer reviews to finally decide if we should start a cooperation for a three-year trial period.
- This was done through SQL analysis and generating various plots with Tableau that gave us insights for our final decision.
- The communication within our team was very productive and resulted in a presentation to support our results.

## Challenges Overcame
We mastered the challenge to analyze the given data set in a cooperative way within the given time.

## Additional Reflections
Finally, our analysis resulted in not to cooperate with Magist, but rather to search for an alternative company as outlined in our presentation.
